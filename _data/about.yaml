Abstract: >
  This website is an online repository for our work on examining the growth and division of Caulobacter crescentus over time. Studying the growth and division
  of individual cells is crucial for understanding how organisms develop, how tumores grow, and many other fundamental biological processes. Our team tried 
  to establish a generative model to describe the growth of single Caulobacter cells.

Summary:  >
  In this work, we explore whether Caulobacter bacterium grows exponentially or linearly by considering 2 theoretical models. We build a generative model for each
  and perform parameter estimates for a0 (area bacterium occupies in the microscope) and k (growth rate). We conclude by comparing the two models to see which better describes 
  bacterium growth. 
  The data we use in this data analysis project comes from a clever experimental set-up that allows 
  imaging of single dividing cells in conditions that are identical through time. This is accomplished by taking 
  advantage of a unique morphological feature of Caulobacter. The mother cell is adherent to the a surface through its 
  stalk. Upon division, one of the daughter cells does not have a stalk and is mobile. The system is part of a 
  microfluidic device that gives a constant flow. So, every time a mother cell divides, the un-stalked daughter cell 
  gets washed away. In such a way, the dividing cells are never in a crowded environment and the buffer is always 
  fresh. This also allows for easier segmentation.
  It is well known that in ideal conditions, bacteria grow exponentially. One bacterium divides to form two, those 
  two divide to form four, those four divide to form eight, and so on. We were able to use the data produced as 
  described above to identify a model that best describes the growth of a single bacterium.
  We examined a linear and an exponential model and our results show that the two models are similar to each other. 
  In fact, if we write the exponential equation as a Taylor series and truncate at the first term, we get the linear 
  equation.
  Another point of consideration is the regime from which we collected the measurements. Essentially exponential 
  growth can be seen as linear if we "zoom in" in time enough. So even in the cases where the linear model works better, we 
  cannot rule out the scenario of exponential growth.
