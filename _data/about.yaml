  The Growth of Caulobacter

Abstract: >
  This is a website template for conveying your data, code, and
  overall scientific story to the general public! See the
  [GitHub](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_website) for the actual code
  used to generate this website, along with lengthy documentation about how to use
  it. This is meant to be used in tandem with the [GitHub repository template for
  reproducible research](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_research). The
  Rest of this website is filled with dummy text (my favorite, [Hiptser
  Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/)) for demonstrative purposes. It can even include
  math like


  $$S = k_b\ln \Omega. \tag{1}$$



  This website is an online repository for our work on examining the growth and division of Caulobacter crescentus over time. Studying the growth and division
  of individual cells is crucial for understanding how organisms develop, how tumores grow, and many other fundamental biological processes. Our team tried 
  to establish a generative model to describe the growth of single Caulobacter cells.
Summary:  >
  In this work, we explore whether Caulobacter bacterium grows exponentially or linearly by considering 2 theoretical models. We build a generative model for each
  and perform parameter estimates for a0 (area bacterium occupies in the microscope) and k (growth rate). We conclude by comparing the two models to see which better describes 
  bacterium growth.
